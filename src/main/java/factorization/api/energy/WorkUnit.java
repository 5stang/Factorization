/**
 * A single unit of some kind of power, with energy sufficient to do one 'work action'.
 * A 'work action' is equivalent to a machine doing something, such as smelting an ore, breaking a block,
 * or pushing a block.
 * <p/>
 * There are no fractional work actions. (Well, there may be fractional work actions internal to a machine, for, eg,
 * transferring a liquid between tanks.) In general there should be a one-to-one correspondence between receiving a
 * WorkUnit and something happening that the player can see. It may also be reasonable for a machine to use multiple
 * WorkUnits (possibly of different kinds!) for different steps, such as to spin up, warm up, and fire.
 * <p/>
 * WorkUnit converters should have some inefficiency, such as using 1 input unit for each 16 units converted.
 * <p/>
 * Some types of energy need special information. For example, a machine powered by pressure might want to know what
 * the fluid is; a gearbox needs to keep in sync with the crankshaft. You can make this information available by
 * extending this class.
