\title{Charge}

Charge is used to generate power, and the power is consumed by \link{processing}{processing machines}, some \link{socket}{socket tools}, and \link{servo}{servos}.

Water boilers will suck of water from source blocks beneath them,
or it can be pumped into them from other means.
It will output steam to steam turbines above it,
and the turbine will generate the charge.
It will also move steam and water upwards through other water boilers.
There are two ways to heat the water into steam.


Mirrors can be placed in a circle around the water boiler.
Ten mirrors will be sufficient to generate a small
amount of charge.
This method does require quite a bit of silver.
% (Luckily silver has few other uses.)

% NOTE: Bug here. The boiler has to be located at X=3, Y=3 to get the mirrors to render pointing at it.

\newpage
The other way is to use a caliometric burner.
The caliometric burner will digest the food fed to it,
and convert it into heat.
Better quality food lasts longer.

More than one caliometric burner can be used against
a water boiler.

\title{Transfer}

Charge is transfered using lead wiring.
It can also be transfered amongst other blocks that use charge.

\title{Measuring}

The charge meter is a hand-held device that will measure
the amount of charge in a conductive block.

Many blocks have other measurable properties
that this item is able to measure.

\newpage
\title{Storage}

There are a few ways of storing charge.

One way is to simply have a lot of wiring.
Of course, this requires more space,
can not be measured by a comparator,
and can not be moved by hand.

The battery block stores a relatively small
amount of power,
but they come pre-charged.
It is used in the crafting of motors.
A comparator can measure how full it is.
When broken, it will keep its charge.

The leyden can store a large amount of power.
It is quite cheap to craft,
but is extremely inefficient.
It also requires a large amount of power before
it can even start charging.
Like the battery,
a comparator will measure how full it is,
and it will retain its storage when broken.
