Carrying this book everywhere you go may become burdensome,
which is why its text has been written to be
satisfying and easy to digest.

The Manual Sandwich,
or "Manwich", is high in fiber
and heaping with protein.
Eating so much meat in a single sitting is once in a lifetime experience!
If you're looking for a meal with a little more kick to it,
