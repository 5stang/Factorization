Squeezing an ink sac between a book and your \lmp\ has
printed its internal encyclopedia to this convenient analog format.

This kit emphasizes design and creation,
rather than crafting and clicking buttons in GUIs.
This is about engineering.
We are focused on making everything possible,
not on making things easy.

May you employ our parts to their full potential.
