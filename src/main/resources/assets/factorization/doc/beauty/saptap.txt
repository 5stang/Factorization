\title{The Sap Tap}

There's more than one way to harvest energy from the sun.
Trees have been collecting sunlight long before mankind first reflected it onto \link{solarboilers}{Solar Boilers}!
The Sap Tap extracts a thick and foul-tasting sap from trees.
It is quite unpaletable, but the \link{calio}{Caliometric Burner}, having no tongue, won't notice.
Small trees do not produce sufficient sap to be worthwhile;
large custom trees produce the best output.

The sap tap can only collect sap when placed underneath a log.

A good sap-producing tree will have hundreds of logs, and many leaves;
the \link{leafbomb}{Leaf Bomb} is useful for applying leaves to trees.

Placing multiple sap taps nearby will anger the trees, so as a safety precaution this is not allowed.
