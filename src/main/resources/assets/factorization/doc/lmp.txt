\title{The Logic Matrix Programmer}

The Logic Matrix Programmer (LMP) is the primary tool for Factorization.

It contains a repository of software,
and the data it caries is important and ubiquitous.

Cloning an LMP is fairly simple,
however, obtaining the first one is not.
They can be found in dungeon chests and stronghold libraries.
Village librarians can be convinced to part with one.

If you are far from civilization, know the data can be
derived from the music disks “11” and “13” using stenography.
Creepers drop music disks when killed by skeletons.
