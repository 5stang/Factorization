\title{The Logic Matrix Programmer\#{item.factorization:tool/matrix_programmer}}

The Logic Matrix Programmer (LMP) is the primary tool for Factorization.

It contains a repository of software,
and the data it caries is important and ubiquitous.

Cloning an LMP is fairly simple;
however, obtaining the first one can be a bit difficult.
The easiest way to find one is to convince a librarian villager to part with one, for a few emeralds\#{item.emerald}.
They can also be found in dungeon chests, and stronghold libraries.

If civilization is far away,
know that the data can be derived from music disks using stenography.
Creepers will drop music disks when killed by skeletons.
