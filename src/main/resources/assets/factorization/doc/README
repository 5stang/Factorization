This system is TeX-inspired. Commands:
\p      Starts a new paragraph
\nl     Emits a newline
\-      Bulleted list item
"\ "    Emit a space
\\      Emit a reverse solidus
\newpage
        Emit a new page
\leftpage
        Make the following text start at the top of a left page
\b{content}
\i{content}
\u{content}
\obf{content}
        Apply text stylings to the content.
\title  Emit a title
\h1     Emit a header
\link{destination}{content}
        Emits a hyperlink
\index{destination}{content}
        Like \link, but emits a following newline.
\#{item localization key}
        Embeds an item with that localization key.
        Use /f copylocalkey to get the localization key of an item.
\img{domain:path/to/image.png}
        Embeds an image (untested)
\imgx{width}{height}{domain:path/to/image.png}
        Embeds an image, using the provided width and height (untested)
\figure{<base64-encoded compressed NBT data>}
        Embeds a figure. The /fzdoc-serialize command will create the command for you.
        Figures are created by standing on a pillar made of gold blocks, with two gold block extensions at the base of the figure, and running the /fzdoc-serialize command. (This command may only be available in a deobfuscated environment.)
        Due to block ID issues, only vanilla blocks and items can be safely used.
        All other items & entities will NOT have their IDs synchronized. (Except for the hard-coded FZ ones...)
        Entities should work, but are mostly untested.
        The figure is placed on a separate page, and is scaled to fit.
\generate{path}
        Embeds dynamically generated content.
        But the paths are not documented here!
\seg
\endseg
        deliminates a segment of text; the typesetter will try to prevent pagebreaks in the middle of a segment.
\topic{item localization key}
        Emits the recipes for an item.
        It is also used to index the documentation by item.
        factorization.docs.IndexDocumentation /path/to/topic_index.txt factorization=./
\checkmods{all|some|none}{space deliminated list of modIds}{enabled content}{disabled content}
        Basically an 'if' statement.


A '%' marks a line-comment.
Multiple spaces are ignored.
A single newline is ignored.
Two or more newlines create a real newline.
Commands swallow following spaces. To actually follow a command with a space, do something like "\this\ " to expressly emit a space.



If you are in a dev environment, symlink the resources folder into MC's resource packs folder. This way you can edit the docs, save it, and press 'r' in the doc viewer to refresh.
(Also, you can press 's' to change color schemes.)
