\title{Hot Blocks}

You can easily break any block that you have recently placed.

This makes it easy to fix misplaced blocks,
particularly smoothstone, obsidian, and glass.

You do not need the appropriate tool to break blocks in this manner.

If you leave the world, then your hot blocks will be forgotten.

The last 5 blocks you have placed are kept hot.
