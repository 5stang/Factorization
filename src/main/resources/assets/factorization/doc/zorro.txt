\title{The Zorro Thing}

You.
You're the bigshot.
The man of the house.
You do what needs to be done, and wipe that smirk off your face, junior.

The Hero.

The Protagonist.


And it is you who, with manly agency,
kills bad guys,
and kicks ass,
and carves his mark on the wall,
and settles old scores,
and shot first,
and has the plan he doesn't share,
and knows that dame will be yours by the end of Act IV,
and ignores the stupid rules and the big explosions,
and holsters his gun with a flourish.


Then the Bad Guy, some nancy, proclaims,
"You've been watching too many action movies, Mr. Jones",
but you smoothly reply:
"No. You just haven't watched enough,"
and drop out the window, 5 stories up,
onto your stead, for a clean getaway,
riding to the horizon and the closing credits.

Do you hear what I'm saying? I'm saying that if you land on a horse from a jump off of a building,
you'll be unhurt, and the lead will snap but you don't care, and if you fall exceptionally far, or with blade drawn, or while carying a baby,
you might find your ride gets an extra boost.

But you already knew that. You knew that all along.
