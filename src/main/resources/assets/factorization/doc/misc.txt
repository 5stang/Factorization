% Dedicated recipe viewer mods do a much much better job.
% The output of this is pretty ugly, and there's no way to search for items.
% However, if you would like your machine's custom recipes (not IRecipes!) to be included
% as a backup way of looking at recipes
% send factorization an IMC message "AddRecipeCategory"
% with "Recipe Category Name|path.to.the.ClassHoldingTheRecipes|public_static_field"
% eg FMLInterModComms.sendMessage("factorization",
%                                 "AddRecipeCategory",
%                                 "Lacerator|factorization.oreprocessing.TileEntityGrinder|recipes");
% It will use reflection to explore the contents of the field.
% The field can be either an Iterable or a Map.
%
% Custom IRecipes will be included naturally as part of the exploration of Workbench recipes.

\u{Improved Projectile Physics}

Projectiles now keep the velocity of their thrower,
allowing them to conform to Newton's
-- well-known and highly publicized --
First Law of Motion.
(Implementation of the Third Law is still under construction.)

This applies to snowballs, arrows, splash potions, and enderpearls.

An important consequence of this is that you can survive
a fall from a high place by throwing an enderpearl at the right time.
