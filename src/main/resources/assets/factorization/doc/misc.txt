\u{Improved Projectile Physics}

Projectiles now keep the velocity of their thrower,
allowing them to conform to Newton's
-- well-known and highly publicized --
First Law of Motion.
(Implementation of the Third Law is still under construction.)

This applies to snowballs, arrows, splash potions, and enderpearls.

An important consequence of this is that you can survive
a fall from a high place by throwing an enderpearl at the right time.
