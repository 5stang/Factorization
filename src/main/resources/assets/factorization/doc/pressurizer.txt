\title{The Pressurizer}

The pressurizer is a \link{socket}{socket tool}.
It blows entities, and pumps fluids.

An \lmp\ can configure whether it sucks or blows,
and how fast it operates.
Faster speeds require more \link{charge}{charge} to operate.

It can transfer liquids between the tanks,
and liquids can be drained from, and flooded into, the world.
Higher speeds increase the water pressure when flooding.
However, draining and flooding only work when blowing,
not with sucking.

\newpage

The pressurizer can also be used to blow entities around.
If it is blowing, it can drops items from a backing inventory,
and if it is sucking, it will suck items into the inventory.

When spinning at high speeds,
it is able to move players.

A redstone signal will disable the pressurizer.
