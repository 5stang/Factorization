\title{The Barrel}

Barrels can store up to 64 stacks of a single item.
So, one of them can store 64 * 64 = 4096 sticks,
64 swords, or 64 * 16 = 1024 eggs.

The barrel has no GUI.
Right click with an item what you are holding,
and left click to remove a stack.
Shift left clicking will remove a single item.
Double right-clicking will fill the barrel
from your inventory.

\newpage 
Barrels can have any direction and orientation.
Clicking near the side edge of a block will place the barrel
with its top pointing to that side.

Items can only be extracted from the bottom of the barrel.
Insertion is done from the top, or the back.

\newpage
There are a few important varieties of barrel.

The hopping barrel will pull one item from its above into it,
and push one item out its bottom, at the same speed as a
vanilla hopper.
It also hops.
A direct redstone signal will disable it.

The silky barrel will hold its contents
if it is broken with a silk-touch axe.


\newpage

If you are under the influence of a Strength Potion,
you can push barrels with a knockback sword.
Be wary when pushing them up stairs, as they can slip.
