\newpage\title{Instructions and Decorations}

A length of \link{servorail}{servo rail} can hold either an instruction or a decoration.
These things are placed on the rail by right-clicking,
and can be removed by shift right-clicking with an \lmp .
If the servo rail containg an instruction is recieving a redstone signal,
then the instruction will be disabled.

An instruction is simply data, so it can be placed infinitely.
Servos are able to copy them off the rail.
Decorations, on the other hand, are physical objects.

% This would be a good place for a list of instructions...
