\title{Deprecation}

Perfection can not be created without destruction.

\nl

The Mixer and the Packager will be removed in 0.9,
since the Compression Crafter can do everything that they can.
Additional features are being added to make up for them!

Charge transimission will be completely rewritten in 0.9, which might require some rewiring.

The Steam Turbine will be removed soon.

Servos will lose their memory in the 0.9.100 release. You should make sure that you can easily reset your servo systems from a blank servo.
