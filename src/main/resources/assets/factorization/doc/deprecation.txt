The Mixer and the Packager will be removed in 0.9,
since the Compression Crafter can do everything that they can.
Additional features are being added to make up for them!

Charge transimission will be completely rewritten in 0.9, which might require some rewiring.

The Steam Turbine will be removed soon.
