0.3.2
  Internal workings of barrels changed so that they should now work with Logistics Pipes, and should be more likely to work with other item-moving systems.
  Buildcraft API no longer used
  Redstone, Tin, and Copper ore are now slaggable.
  Since I found like 4 silver veins right next eachother in my playtest world, silver is now twice as rare.
