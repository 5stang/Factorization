[Features]
Some electricity related mecha-upgrades?
funny chicken noise on bandwidth upgrade
https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3/commit/e1ed736955b9af238431358bad405e306833f36a
exorcize demons (from the recipes. But leave the chest thing in and pretend it isn't there.)
redstone signal on craftpacket maker/stamper

[Mecha-Features]
Nicen up the Mecha-Modder
Armor-type specific upgrades
Re-write the event system:
  EventSources: Player state, key presses from client
  EventShaders: Normal, Rising edge, falling edge, negated, toggle
Anti-gravity (uses inverium'd lead blocks): Velocity limiting, hovering, high jumping

[High-priority Bugs]
http://i.imgur.com/db3Ij.jpg -- see the holes? Are those still a problem?
test high block IDs
check breaking on all new machines
solar turbines need to check if it's raining. It's okay if you're in a desert tho.
<OvermindDL1> For note, the grinder keeps not accepting power, breaking and replacing it fixes it for an MC day or so, then it breaks again
craft packet makers shouldn't eat paper.

[Low-Priority Bugs]
draw_active isn't marking the block dirty apparently?
re-write the shift-clicking function to use slots!!!
silver ore needs to be toughened up just a tad!
check normal fire interactions w/ our TEs
two issues with buttons in mecha-modder: doesn't update when blank armor put in; reinforcing w/ vanilla armor doesn't hide buttons
shift-clicking the shard recipe doesn't do the thing. *and*, stamping them doesn't work either!!!
do block breaking animations properly (after 1.3). Look at src/minecraft/net/minecraft/src/RenderGlobal.java +1569 renderWorld()
drop several stacks instantaneously into a transposer running into a barrel. Only 1 stack will be put in.
barrel lighting (normals.)
railgun, except for steve
sign enchanting
optimize these TEs. Prolly use whatever it is that Entity Models use.

left-handled BoH: craft with a compass (get the compass back?) This can be reversed of course.
have sentry demon send redstone signal when it senses shit
  player: signal on top.
  mob: signal to side
Convert to using a single block ID & MD for everything. There's a nice function in ItemBlock....
  will use MD for various block properties tho
wrath lamp:
  every 5 seconds, check if powered. If so, remove lightair (And change to an unlight block?)


does the regexp ban work?
Can we convert the TE filter to use a regexp?
spam-clicking the barrel on SMP gets the client confused

always test everything in SMP! jegus!
redstone! We want the router to behave like glass...
  - Don't spread signal (like glass)
  - Allow redstone to be put on it (unlike glass)
  Wait! What about glowstone?
When updating router could pick the closest of N (where N is small, say 2-4) off the top of the frontier
TODO: Configuration value: A regex of TileEntities that the router may not connect to
                           And also a regex of TileEntities that may only be accessed via a side?
on item pickup: only consider biting if not poisoned...? Need to do something proper. Maaaybe.... well, if the guy's inv is full, it's only a problem.
should be possible to die through sloppy carelessness. Should be easy to stay safe if you're careful.
it'd be nice if the pocketcrafter restored the previous GUI when closed. It seems that simply restoring the old GuiScreen on close doesn't work...
barrel bug: damaged items can be inserted via tubes. Not solvable at this time. But we can verify BC's...

Need more uses for diamond shards!
  Grinding head. Saw blade. Shard spear? :o  Something about dark crystals. 


backup occasionally, eh?
do vararg functions have to be for Objects?

  only allows in items with color/dye names. Sorts them automagically by color.
  proooobably won't be able to implement ISidedInventory decently. :(
  How will the server know what's colored?
    1. Create a list of all the colored dyes. Be sure to check the OreDictionary for dyes..
    2. Iterate over all the crafting recipes:
      If the recipe contains a single item from the list (and any additional items not on the list), add it to the list.
    3. Repeat step 2 until nothing else is added.
  each color gets 3 slots
  clicking on a slot will put it in the regular inventory.
  And... stuff added to the regular inventory'll try to be moved to their color slots.

  Okay. So items can be taken from the slots, but they can't be put in. They have to be inserted indirectly via the extra
  slots on the bottom.

DEMONS
======
Tiny Demon
  24+ netherwort in a chest in the nether
  Tiny demons are secretive creatures that can be found in the nether, though they usually stay out of sight. Their favorite activities are eating netherwort, and biting you with their poisonous fangs. If they find a chest containing plenty of netherwort, they are sure to sneak in and become trapped inside. They will certainly bite you when handled.
  A chest must have at least 24 netherwort to attract your first demon. If you are paying attention, you can remove it before it eats all your netherwort. No more than 1 demon will enter a chest per minute.
    
Bound Tiny Demon:
  ~D  String, tiny demon
  Tying a bit of string to a demon permits safer handling and allows you to put it to work.

Demon On A Stick:
  B Bound demon, A Stick
  |
  |
    Tying a bound tiny demon onto the end of a long stick enables you to apply its poisonous fangs directly to your enemies without hurting yourself.
    Doesn't last very long. Probably as long as a wooden sword? Or a golden sword?
  

Wand of Cooling:
   OD   Bound tiny demon, obsidian, flint&steel, iron ingot
   FO
  I  
    The Wand of Cooling is made by binding a demon to a mini-portal. The demon allows high-energy air molecules through the portal, but keeps lower energy molecules out, thus lowering the average temperature of the surounding area. The molecules will be sent to some other Place. The wand of cooling will:
      Put you out if you're on fire
      Eliminate any lava that you're in (TODO: works poorly)
      Cool lava into obsidian
      Freezes water
      removes non-source lava and water blocks.
      Extinguish normal fire, and Wrath Fire.
    Due to the durability & simplicity of its components, the Wand of Cooling lasts for a fairly long time.

  Used to make a refrigerator? Carnot engines?
  Uses Laplaces demon connected to an nether portal.

bag of holding
  Crafting recipe:
      lol   Leather, Ender pearl, dark iron
      IlI
       I
  Upgrade size by crafting with an enderpearl, a dark iron ingot, and leather. Each upgrade adds a single column. 
  OR, we could upgrade by adding other bags? That'd be cool too.
  maybe which vertical slot it is in selects functionality?
  possible TODO:
    shift-` to move items the other way?
    Right click the bag to open up its inventory. Or ctrl-`?


Mecha-upgrades:
  Free:
    bouyancy barrel
    internal piston
    cobblestone drive
  Electric:
    charcoal filter
    thermal environmental control
    sugar water?
  Antium:
    upgrades from slowing falling to slight hovering to flying amongst the birds
    something to feed you
    



Clay
  clay ball above wooden slab --> modelling stand
  clay ball on stick --> modelling tool
    Icon: A clay ball on a stick! With an additional icon...

  modelling tools: Doesn't stack. Any tool can be converted to another one. shift-right click to change tools.
    adder: consumes a clay ball to add a prism, a centered .5², and selects it
      green +
    remover: removes selected prism, returns a clay ball
      red -
    selector: right click selects a nearby prism (or a prism that's behind what's currently selected), left click cycles selection
      yellow box
      (Shift left-click with any tool might also work as a selector)
    translator: right click to move a prism 1 pixel (configable) towards you; left click to move away (snapped to axiis...)
      blue «
    rotator: rotates prism cc (or ccw) 15° along the axis you are looking down
      magenta ⟳
    stretcher: moves the nearest face of selected 1 px towards you (Will be difficult when rotating...)
      orange <|
  prisms may move outside of the 1m cube, but no farther than a 3m cube
  You should be able to walk on them!
  However, rotated stuff may be tricky... perhaps no collision for them?
    BUT, stuff that's rotated in 90° increments should collide still.
  Make selected prism yellow. If not collidable, perhaps make it magenta.
  Selection should be user-independent! But we might want an indication of what other users have selected... maybe a white outline or sommat.


  So, it's all clay to begin with. Then bisque it. No longer editable. May then be glazed, or made into a mold.
  glazed pieces can be fired again to get rid of the modelling stand, and make them permament.



Rockets
    Fueld with vast amounts of TNT. Must be made with high-fire clay... or extreme high fire clay? :O
  Some components made using clay molds (wings, heat shield tiling)
  Possible idea: Let C = brick, B = Slimeball
  CCC
  CBC  - heat shield mold

infused lapis?

We want stuff that's made using all the different kinds of ore storage blocks!
  Diamond: Diamond shards
  Iron: Dark iron
  Lapis: ??? Possibly some kind of cooling thing...
  Gold: ??? Possibly some kind of electricity thing???





[19:02:37] <ShaRose> ok
[19:03:04] <ShaRose> we can't (easily) use bytecode hackery to edit every mod that hardcodes -256 to -4096
[19:03:18] <ShaRose> but if they use that method, we change that one method and we don't need to do anything else
[19:05:09] <CowedOffACliff> okay now I see the difference
[19:07:53] <absurdHuman> What are we supposed to do instead of subtract 256 from everything?
[19:08:17] <CowedOffACliff> What class does that method actually want though?....
[19:08:34] <-- armed_troop has left this server (Quit: armed_troop).
[19:08:37] <CowedOffACliff> does it want a subclass of ItemBlock, or ItemBlock itself?
[19:10:20] <ShaRose> absurdHuman honestly, the way I did it for ID resolver (detecting the offset) was to check the first item
[19:10:26] <ShaRose> I think it's shovelsteel?
[19:10:34] <ShaRose> just get the index from that, that's the offset to use
[19:10:38] <absurdHuman> hmm
[19:10:48] <cpw> cowed any subclass of ItemBlock
[19:10:52] <ShaRose> if forge decides to move blocks higher than 256 to 32001+ though, that won't work either
[19:10:54] <cpw> or just ItemBlock
[19:11:00] <ShaRose> yeah
[19:11:01] <cpw> look at ironchest for an example of use
[19:11:02] <CowedOffACliff> I guess I just don't have the right constructor
[19:11:06] <CowedOffACliff> or something


Whatchya gonna do, oh, whatchya gonna do
