HAMMER
------
✓ Step 1 is "create a dimension"
✓ Step 2 is "give the client an extra world for that dimension"
  Step 3 is "create pseudoplayer, have packets sent to the pseudoplayer be sent to the real players, and render part of the dimension"
✓     -    have packets go to all players near the DSE; single PacketProxyingPlayer per DSE
✓     -    send chunks to players
      -    Actually update the terrain when it changes
      -    Actually consistently render the terrain when spawned
✓ Step 4 is to make the DSE interact with the real world
✓     -    DSE persistence
✓     -    external entity collisions, using custom AABBs
  Step 5 is to get player interactions working
✓     -    placing blocks
✓     -    activating blocks
      -    GUIs
      -    breaking blocks
              - We'll just do everything ourselves; no trying to go through vanilla code

              - Server-side: Client will send packets similar to Packet14BlockDig; we'll bamboozle ItemInWorldManager (Or replace it with our own, possibly temporarily. This might be better, as it'd be very simple to replace it when we're done.)
              - Client-side: Can we set fields in places to make it do the digging animation?
              - Do that IWorldAccess partial block breaking rendering on the client; make sure the player packet proxy gets the packets
X Step 6 is to get rotations working (Maybe later)
X     -    Get collisions working when rotated
  Step 7 is rockets & shit.
      -    Refactor DSE & its rendering for Oracles
✓     -    Proper command system
  Step 8 is watch mod interaction burst into flames.
      -    Put in a whitelist for Blocks, Entities, and TileEntities. (Probably a Object.getClass() mapping)
  Step 9 is "drop into the pending mods folder; run away giggling."

CovertJaguar_proper_packet_sending

The hard rendering bit:
  On server:
    the player is made frozen/immortal somehow
    a puppet player is put in hammerspace
    packets go through frozen player normally
    puppet player wraps the packets
  On client:
    we leave our real player behind for the puppet player...
    so we change Minecraft.thePlayer to... the puppet player entity that the server's created

So, rewriting it. When the player gets embedded onto a DSE:
  Create the puppet player, spawn it into hammerspace
  Change the EntityPlayer that the socket is connected to to the puppet.
  Make the real EntityPlayer immortal/ghostly somehow. In particular, skeles need to ignore it. But it still needs to receive all other packets.
  It also needs to stay near the DSE when it moves
  PacketProxyPlayer needs to (or should) stop sending packets to the puppet-mastering player
  puppet player needs to wrap its packets
  Tell the player that they're now controlling the puppet

REARCHITECTING
--------------
Kill Wrath (This will make the mod so much simpler...):
  - Wrath lamp will require a ton of nebulae to craft
  - Dark iron obtained in ore form from asteroids (or if that takes too long, from inverium-ing iron blocks)
  - Actual wrath fire will be gone. So:
      - No more wrath forges
      - No more lighting things on fire
      - No more terrible particle effects
  - This will remove a use for diamond shards.


KILL
----
BOH
WRATH (But this adds rocketry. Ha. Definitely makes the mod smaller.)
All glazes except for mimicing

SERVOS
------
regarding actuators:
  Move them out of the inventory, into a separate thing
  Have these actuators:
    Freaky Robot Hand: Deployer. Not much more to it. (I mean unless you want left click. Erm.)
    Computer: Evaluate stack (and stuff)
    Inventory Manipulator: by itself, a boring push/pull
    Grabber: Picks up blocks and entities. Uses FZDS fun-times.
  We'll keep a "generic use actuator instruction", but we'll also add instructions for each actuator. Possibly multiple ones per actuator.
Servos need to IO items badly!
Lower barriers to entry for servos:
    (Suuuugar crystalllss.... hard rock candy....)
  Eliminate dependencies on ore processing:
    alternative aqua regia recipe (substitute blaze powder for nether powder? or maybe magma cream?)
      Maybe this shouldn't make aqua regia; but instead an acid that's compatible.
  Maybe we should see about flattening our mod in other areas as well.

TOP LIST (that's become somewhat less tops. Oops.)

compression crafters:
  flowerpots
  blocks of hardness -1
  making wrath lamps
One of my ICommands is broken (???)
slag furnace. dude. fix the not-lighting-up thing already.
[15:43:34] <Hathadar> I have a router inserting into 4 induction furnaces.  The moment I place a machine filter on it and set it to the induction furnace it stops working.  It will not insert or extract.  0.8.01
I wonder if the bug hopper has any interesting crashlogs!
One of my ICommands is broken!?
localize barrel types (There's a ton of other things what need to be localized, y'know...)
barrels ejecting items like mDiyo berries do
leyden jars & batteries should overcharge slightly so that they can drop exactly 100%-charged stuff
★★★Talk to RLP about monetization plan★★★
underground silver temples/vaults. With moon lamps? :D
onInventoryUpdate all the TEs
fix redstone getting stuck on for servo rail pulses
can't glaze a sculpture cloned from an already glazed sculpture
change raw glaze colors to their real colors
smooth sandstone double slab (Are there other variants?)
Look at what errors we get if the FZDS code isn't in
either bats are spawning in the hammer dimension, or we're getting entity updates that we shouldn't be
having more boilers/mirrors seems to give you more steam somehow
Misc Nonsense:
  fix vanilla's middle clicking
notification system upgrade:
  extra controls for clearing up other notifications: get rid of nearby messages (barrels), start fading the message away as soon as it shows up (energy measurements), remove any messages that have the same typename as this one, leave the message up for # seconds
  being able to group messages together might be nice; so you could do "clear tutorialMessages".
Modularize FZ/astro so that astro has no deps & can be removed for public release
Config option for ore processing output
IMC for adding new Ores to the Ore Processing chain?
configuration method for adding ores?
Placing/breaking wrath lamp in hammerspace seems to cause the client to crap its pants
Don't keep non-weak references to worlds ("MapMaker.weakKeys().buildMap()") except in Entity/TileEntity
register ore blocks
To kill NEI's shift-? cheat: clear out RecipeInfo.overlayMap... or something.  Hmm....
  Might want to just remove instances whose class = DefaultOverlayHandler or BrewingOverlayHandler.

back to ceramics?
   - a new tool: export to obj tool. And if we have an export, maybe an import would be nice. Could export the sculpture, or export the chunk! Use a hacked up tessellator.

[Low-Priority Bugs]
> Apparently, Killing yourself by Drinking Sulfuric Acid, will dupe the acid. Hence I started with 8, drank two, and I now have 12.
Get rid of as many getEffectiveSide() calls as we can; we often have a World hanging around somewhere we can use instead.
implementing that generic block rotation API when it comes out if ever
barrel lighting (normals.); it's a bit dark on dark mode.
do block breaking animations properly (after 1.3). Look at src/minecraft/net/minecraft/src/RenderGlobal.java +1569 renderWorld()
optimize these TEs. Prolly use whatever it is that Entity Models use?
  grinder

[Features]
Redstone signal on furnace heaters
right-clicking a barrel with a tool could put stuff in as if you had right-clicked with an empty hand
glowing glazes
ore processing for dark iron (and possibly wrath-burn other blocks besides iron)
Go over our API stuff. Clean up. Make sure other people can actually use stuff. (Maybe test this?)
slowpoke discussion re. barrel balancing. Maybe an upgrade for automating barrel content access?
Occasionally enable all warnings & clean things up
railgun, except for steve

always test everything in SMP! jegus!

Need more uses for diamond shards!
  Shard spear? :o  Something about dark crystals. 

backup occasionally, eh?


SPACE

FZDS Uses:
  Asteroids (Natural/Artificial Satelites, Planetoids, motherships)
  Space ships
  Megabosses
  Rotatable Frames? Robotics? Real Mecha Suits?


COSMOLOGY
---------
The world is an infinite plane. Other dimensions (nether, end, mystcraft ages) are not something you can walk to. The Farlands/End of the World don't actually exist, since that's just an artificial limitation of the computer game.
Light has no speed limit, but it does have a propagation limit. Light comes in several classes. A photon has these properties: Color, direction, travel distance, and class (sky illumination, torch/block illumination, reflection of illumination, and entity/FX-emitted). Steve's retinas can only perceieve reflected and emitted light, not illumination; they also can not detect photons that have travelled over a certain distance.
The world of Minecraft is an infinite plane suspend above over an infinite black hole. The black hole plane will crush anything that gets near it. It can bend light (causing void fog). If you fall into the void, your view will be squashed!
Inverium is what prevents the world from falling into the void. It can be found only underneath bedrock. Don't mine it; that would cause the world to fall into the void. Inverium is anti-void. You can try dropping it into the void, but it will float at around y=1
Inverium can also be found in the asteroids above. If you remove the inverium from them, they will (eventually, not immediately) fall to the ground. (But they will most likely burn up in the atmosphere?)
The inverium supporting the overworld has guardians. We wouldn't want the world to fall down, now would we?

  only allows in items with color/dye names. Sorts them automagically by color.
  proooobably won't be able to implement ISidedInventory decently. :(
  How will the server know what's colored?
    1. Create a list of all the colored dyes. Be sure to check the OreDictionary for dyes..
    2. Iterate over all the crafting recipes:
      If the recipe contains a single item from the list (and any additional items not on the list), add it to the list.
    3. Repeat step 2 until nothing else is added.
  each color gets 3 slots
  clicking on a slot will put it in the regular inventory.
  And... stuff added to the regular inventory'll try to be moved to their color slots.

  Okay. So items can be taken from the slots, but they can't be put in. They have to be inserted indirectly via the extra
  slots on the bottom.

Wand of Cooling:
  Eliminate any lava that you're in (TODO: works poorly)
  Due to the durability & simplicity of its components, the Wand of Cooling lasts for a fairly long time.
  Used to make a refrigerator? Carnot engines?

Shapeless Recipes & the Mixer
=============================
I'd like to change the mixer into a machine that crafts shapeless recipes. But there's a few items that makes this weird.

New mixer recipe:
  IXI Iron, X=fan, Redstone, Motor, Lead, Cauldron
  RMR
  LCL

And stop rendering with water in it

Crafting limitations:
  books, vanilla has "3 paper + 1 leather". Change to:
    PPP
     L

  Writable book, vanilla has "1 book, 1 feather, 1 inksack". Change to
     F
    BI

  single-items (sugar, bonemeal; use a stamper)
  Probably only vanilla ShapelessRecipe and forge ShapelessOreRecipe
  Maybe aks someone if doing this is cool?
  Would definitely need a config option for this

Crafting extensions:
  May want an API! Simple... if irecipe.getClass() in someClassList, composed of:
    RecipesArmorDyes.class
    RecipeFireworks.class

Note: Can't simply run it in a 2x2 crafting grid; might have a recipe requiring "2 foo, 1 bar", but vanilla-style'd have it crafted like "FBF"; we need to be able to craft it even if they're not separated out


WRATH
=====

   
bag of holding
  Crafting recipe:
      lol   Leather, Ender pearl, dark iron
      IlI
       I
  Upgrade size by crafting with an enderpearl, a dark iron ingot, and leather. Each upgrade adds a single column. 
  OR, we could upgrade by adding other bags? That'd be cool too.
  maybe which vertical slot it is in selects functionality?
  possible TODO:
    shift-` to move items the other way?
    Right click the bag to open up its inventory. Or ctrl-`?


Clay
  clay ball above wooden slab --> modelling stand
  clay ball on stick --> modelling tool
    Icon: A clay ball on a stick! With an additional icon...

  modelling tools: Doesn't stack. Any tool can be converted to another one. shift-right click to change tools.
    adder: consumes a clay ball to add a prism, a centered .5², and selects it
      green +
    remover: removes selected prism, returns a clay ball
      red -
    selector: right click selects a nearby prism (or a prism that's behind what's currently selected), left click cycles selection
      yellow box
      (Shift left-click with any tool might also work as a selector)
    translator: right click to move a prism 1 pixel (configable) towards you; left click to move away (snapped to axiis...)
      blue «
    rotator: rotates prism cc (or ccw) 15° along the axis you are looking down
      magenta ⟳
    stretcher: moves the nearest face of selected 1 px towards you (Will be difficult when rotating...)
      orange <|
  prisms may move outside of the 1m cube, but no farther than a 3m cube
  You should be able to walk on them!
  However, rotated stuff may be tricky... perhaps no collision for them?
    BUT, stuff that's rotated in 90° increments should collide still.
  Make selected prism yellow. If not collidable, perhaps make it magenta.
  Selection should be user-independent! But we might want an indication of what other users have selected... maybe a white outline or sommat.


  So, it's all clay to begin with. Then bisque it. No longer editable. May then be glazed, or made into a mold.
  glazed pieces can be fired again to get rid of the modelling stand, and make them permament.

  Nether powder is made by grinding netherrack a few times
    1 netherrack -> 1 netherrack gravel -> 1 netherrack sand -> 3-5 netherrack powder

Boats. Of course, you'll need a splash potion-like to set them afloat. This will, obviously, require the most annoying ingredients available:

  prevents you from using items based on their package? Probably voids them from your inventor as well.

Invasive charge'd be nice (lets you transmit charge through metal blocks)
