Servos Figurings:
    Actuators are Items that implement an Interface
    We'll have 16 servo stacks. (Corresponding to wool colors.)
    We'll have a few pointers to stacks, used for various purposes: equipment/execution, next execution, argument, IO buffer, onEnterBlock. You can change which stack it points to.
        This is still ugly.
        What if we had a stack per instruction?
          Too many stacks. 1 stack per class of instruction.
          So you could quote an instruction to use as a reference to a stack...
    Bootstrap Decorator:
      Has an adjacent inventory & optional colored block
      Servos passing into it from the bottom get de-equipped
      Servos passing from the other sides get equiped
    So, classes:
      Actuator becomes an interface on Items
      Controller goes away
      We get a new class, "ServoRailWidget". Decorator and Instruction extend them.

HAMMER
------
✓ Step 1 is "create a dimension"
✓ Step 2 is "give the client an extra world for that dimension"
  Step 3 is "create pseudoplayer, have packets sent to the pseudoplayer be sent to the real players, and render part of the dimension"
✓     -    have packets go to all players near the DSE; single PacketProxyingPlayer per DSE
✓     -    send chunks to players
      -    Actually update the terrain when it changes
      -    Actually consistently render the terrain when spawned
✓ Step 4 is to make the DSE interact with the real world
✓     -    DSE persistence
✓     -    external entity collisions, using custom AABBs
  Step 5 is to get player interactions working
✓     -    placing blocks
✓     -    activating blocks
      -    GUIs
      -    breaking blocks
              - Server-side: Client will send packets similar to Packet14BlockDig; we'll bamboozle ItemInWorldManager (Or replace it with our own, possibly temporarily. This might be better, as it'd be very simple to replace it when we're done.)
              - Client-side: Can we set fields in places to make it do the digging animation?
              - Do that IWorldAccess partial block breaking rendering on the client; make sure the player packet proxy gets the packets
✓ Step 6 is to get rotations working
      -    Get collisions working when rotated
  Step 7 is rockets & shit.
      -    Refactor DSE & its rendering for Oracles
✓     -    Proper command system
  Step 8 is watch mod interaction burst into flames.
      -    Put in a whitelist for Blocks, Entities, and TileEntities. (Probably a Object.getClass() mapping)
  Step 9 is "drop into the pending mods folder; run away giggling."

(Uh-oh, why is TransferLib broken?)
CovertJaguar_proper_packet_sending

The hard rendering bit:
  On server:
    the player is made frozen/immortal somehow
    a puppet player is put in hammerspace
    packets go through frozen player normally
    puppet player wraps the packets
  On client:
    we leave our real player behind for the puppet player...
    so we change Minecraft.thePlayer to... the puppet player entity that the server's created

So, rewriting it. When the player gets embedded onto a DSE:
  Create the puppet player, spawn it into hammerspace
  Change the EntityPlayer that the socket is connected to to the puppet.
  Make the real EntityPlayer immortal/ghostly somehow. In particular, skeles need to ignore it. But it still needs to receive all other packets.
  It also needs to stay near the DSE when it moves
  PacketProxyPlayer needs to (or should) stop sending packets to the puppet-mastering player
  puppet player needs to wrap its packets
  Tell the player that they're now controlling the puppet

REARCHITECTING
--------------
Kill Wrath (This will make the mod so much simpler...):
  - Wrath lamp will require a ton of nebulae to craft
  - Dark iron obtained in ore form from asteroids (or if that takes too long, from inverium-ing iron blocks)
  - Actual wrath fire will be gone. So:
      - No more wrath forges
      - No more lighting things on fire
      - No more terrible particle effects
  - This will remove a use for diamond shards.

TO TEST
-------
Wrenching parasieves (Probably alright)
Did the drop bug with BlockFactorization.destroyed_tes get fixed? (Probably alright)


TOP LIST (that's become somewhat less tops. Oops.)
--------
pocket crafting table seems to have issues under... either netlag or server lag. Change the action keys to be done client-side? Hmm. Are we running them both sides, but the server doesn't keep up? That really doesn't make sense tho. This is pretty important, since item loss can occur from this!
make mirrors less of a PITA to break
make chat line limit less suck
Can we safely put "oreQuartz" as an OD grinder recipe w/o messing up with Applied Energetics?
underground silver temples/vaults. With moon lamps? :D
onInventoryUpdate all the TEs
fix redstone getting stuck on for servo rail pulses
bag of holding width tooltip
breaking lead wiring with fist doesn't drop
determine what the real colors of all these raw glazes are
smooth sandstone double slab (Are there other variants?)
The new IInventory has stuff for preventing things from being put into slots. All machines, and especially routers.
Tossing barrels (Or, well, anything) through mystcraft portals with the gravity gun
Look at what errors we get if the FZDS code isn't in
either bats are spawning in the hammer dimension, or we're getting entity updates that we shouldn't be
Misc Nonsense:
  fix vanilla's middle clicking
notification system upgrade:
  IMC system for sending messages (should work server & client side)
  be able to specify: an entity ID, a floating position, or a coordinate
  be able to send an item along with the message. It'll serialize it & stuff. And then there'll be format messages that control how the item is shown: the item name, the item name + the extra information, render the item in-line with the text, or render the item to the side of the message
  extra controls for clearing up other notifications: get rid of nearby messages (barrels), start fading the message away as soon as it shows up (energy measurements), remove any messages that have the same typename as this one, leave the message up for # seconds
Modularize FZ/astro so that astro has no deps & can be removed for public release
Config option for ore processing output
configuration method for adding ores?
test with dedicated server (not from eclipse....)
Placing/breaking wrath lamp in hammerspace seems to cause the client to crap its pants
Don't keep non-weak references to worlds ("MapMaker.weakKeys().buildMap()") except in Entity/TileEntity
RP heating
register ore blocks
To kill NEI's shift-? cheat: clear out RecipeInfo.overlayMap... or something.  Hmm....
  Might want to just remove instances whose class = DefaultOverlayHandler or BrewingOverlayHandler.

   - a new tool: export to obj tool. And if we have an export, maybe an import would be nice. Could export the sculpture, or export the chunk! Use a hacked up tessellator.

[Low-Priority Bugs]
Comparators & barrels
> Apparently, Killing yourself by Drinking Sulfuric Acid, will dupe the acid. Hence I started with 8, drank two, and I now have 12.
Redstone signal on furnace heaters
right-clicking a barrel with a tool could put stuff in as if you had right-clicked with an empty hand
Get rid of as many getEffectiveSide() calls as we can; we often have a World hanging around somewhere we can use instead.
Fun fact: High-quality batteries can be made out of silver. Mmmm. But this can't really be used as an alternative... altho... maybe they could require greater charge to charge.
implementing that generic block rotation API when it comes out if ever
we miiight let you use capsules & shit in the mixer
barrel lighting (normals.); it's a bit dark on dark mode.
Test: slow stamper & packager & maker so as to not jam filters. also have stamper pulse for each item... (cakes)
nikolite grinding! Once RedPower comes out...  :(
check normal fire interactions w/ our TEs; fire's invisible on certain blocks? (Slag furnace maybe.)
do block breaking animations properly (after 1.3). Look at src/minecraft/net/minecraft/src/RenderGlobal.java +1569 renderWorld()
railgun, except for steve
optimize these TEs. Prolly use whatever it is that Entity Models use?
  grinder
sideways barrels (and possibly upsidedown barrels)
slowpoke discussion re. barrel balancing. Maybe an upgrade for automating barrel content access?
ore processing for dark iron (and possibly wrath-burn other blocks besides iron)
Go over our API stuff. Clean up. Make sure other people can actually use stuff. (Maybe test this?)
Re. heaters on RP alloy furnaces:
<Eloraam> well you could easily add fuel...  you're welcome to change burntime and totalburn from TileAlloyFurnace... probably via reflection?
<Eloraam> they're both public, work just like the vanilla furnace iirc
<Eloraam> i'd prefer not changing the actual cook time tho
^ no speedy cooking? LAAAAAAAAME

Occasionally enable all warnings & clean things up

always test everything in SMP! jegus!

Need more uses for diamond shards!
  Shard spear? :o  Something about dark crystals. 

backup occasionally, eh?


SPACE
=====
FZDS Uses:
  Asteroids (Natural/Artificial Satelites, Planetoids, motherships)
  Space ships
  Megabosses
  Rotatable Frames? Robotics? Real Mecha Suits?


COSMOLOGY
---------
The world is an infinite plane. Other dimensions (nether, end, mystcraft ages) are not something you can walk to. The Farlands/End of the World don't actually exist, since that's just an artificial limitation of the computer game.
Light has no speed limit, but it does have a propagation limit. Light comes in several classes. A photon has these properties: Color, direction, travel distance, and class (sky illumination, torch/block illumination, reflection of illumination, and entity/FX-emitted). Steve's retinas can only perceieve reflected and emitted light, not illumination; they also can not detect photons that have travelled over a certain distance.
The world of Minecraft is an infinite plane suspend above over an infinite black hole. The black hole plane will crush anything that gets near it. It can bend light (causing void fog). If you fall into the void, your view will be squashed!
Inverium is what prevents the world from falling into the void. It can be found only underneath bedrock. Don't mine it; that would cause the world to fall into the void. Inverium is anti-void. You can try dropping it into the void, but it will float at around y=1
Inverium can also be found in the asteroids above. If you remove the inverium from them, they will (eventually, not immediately) fall to the ground. (But they will most likely burn up in the atmosphere?)
The inverium supporting the overworld has guardians. We wouldn't want the world to fall down, now would we?

  only allows in items with color/dye names. Sorts them automagically by color.
  proooobably won't be able to implement ISidedInventory decently. :(
  How will the server know what's colored?
    1. Create a list of all the colored dyes. Be sure to check the OreDictionary for dyes..
    2. Iterate over all the crafting recipes:
      If the recipe contains a single item from the list (and any additional items not on the list), add it to the list.
    3. Repeat step 2 until nothing else is added.
  each color gets 3 slots
  clicking on a slot will put it in the regular inventory.
  And... stuff added to the regular inventory'll try to be moved to their color slots.

  Okay. So items can be taken from the slots, but they can't be put in. They have to be inserted indirectly via the extra
  slots on the bottom.

Wand of Cooling:
  Eliminate any lava that you're in (TODO: works poorly)
  Due to the durability & simplicity of its components, the Wand of Cooling lasts for a fairly long time.
  Used to make a refrigerator? Carnot engines?

Shapeless Recipes & the Mixer
=============================
I'd like to change the mixer into a machine that crafts shapeless recipes. But there's a few items that makes this weird.

New mixer recipe:
  IXI Iron, X=fan, Redstone, Motor, Lead, Cauldron
  RMR
  LCL

And stop rendering with water in it

Crafting limitations:
  books, vanilla has "3 paper + 1 leather". Change to:
    PPP
     L

  Writable book, vanilla has "1 book, 1 feather, 1 inksack". Change to
     F
    BI

  single-items (sugar, bonemeal; use a stamper)
  Probably only vanilla ShapelessRecipe and forge ShapelessOreRecipe
  Maybe aks someone if doing this is cool?
  Would definitely need a config option for this

Crafting extensions:
  May want an API! Simple... if irecipe.getClass() in someClassList, composed of:
    RecipesArmorDyes.class
    RecipeFireworks.class

Note: Can't simply run it in a 2x2 crafting grid; might have a recipe requiring "2 foo, 1 bar", but vanilla-style'd have it crafted like "FBF"; we need to be able to craft it even if they're not separated out


WRATH

  Crafting recipe:
      lol   Leather, Ender pearl, dark iron
      IlI
       I
  Upgrade size by crafting with an enderpearl, a dark iron ingot, and leather. Each upgrade adds a single column. 
  OR, we could upgrade by adding other bags? That'd be cool too.
  maybe which vertical slot it is in selects functionality?
  possible TODO:
    shift-` to move items the other way?
    Right click the bag to open up its inventory. Or ctrl-`?


Clay
  clay ball above wooden slab --> modelling stand
  clay ball on stick --> modelling tool
    Icon: A clay ball on a stick! With an additional icon...

  modelling tools: Doesn't stack. Any tool can be converted to another one. shift-right click to change tools.
    adder: consumes a clay ball to add a prism, a centered .5², and selects it
      green +
    remover: removes selected prism, returns a clay ball
      red -
    selector: right click selects a nearby prism (or a prism that's behind what's currently selected), left click cycles selection
      yellow box
      (Shift left-click with any tool might also work as a selector)
    translator: right click to move a prism 1 pixel (configable) towards you; left click to move away (snapped to axiis...)
      blue «
    rotator: rotates prism cc (or ccw) 15° along the axis you are looking down
      magenta ⟳
    stretcher: moves the nearest face of selected 1 px towards you (Will be difficult when rotating...)
      orange <|
  prisms may move outside of the 1m cube, but no farther than a 3m cube
  You should be able to walk on them!
  However, rotated stuff may be tricky... perhaps no collision for them?
    BUT, stuff that's rotated in 90° increments should collide still.
  Make selected prism yellow. If not collidable, perhaps make it magenta.
  Selection should be user-independent! But we might want an indication of what other users have selected... maybe a white outline or sommat.


  So, it's all clay to begin with. Then bisque it. No longer editable. May then be glazed, or made into a mold.
  glazed pieces can be fired again to get rid of the modelling stand, and make them permament.
