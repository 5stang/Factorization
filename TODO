HAMMER
------
Step 1 is "Create a dimension"
Step 2 is "make the client keep a reference to that dimension, create pseudoplayer, have packets sent to the pseudoplayer be sent to the real player, and render part of the dimension"
Step 3 is to get player/DimensionSlice interaction working.
Step 4 is rockets & shit.
Step 5 is watch mod interaction burst into flames.
Step 6 is "drop into the pending mods folder; run away giggling."

Go over our API stuff. Clean up. Make sure other people can actually use stuff. (Maybe test this?)
Re. heaters on RP alloy furnaces:
<Eloraam> well you could easily add fuel...  you're welcome to change burntime and totalburn from TileAlloyFurnace... probably via reflection?
<Eloraam> they're both public, work just like the vanilla furnace iirc
<Eloraam> i'd prefer not changing the actual cook time tho
^ no speedy cooking? LAAAAAAAAME



always test everything in SMP! jegus!

Need more uses for diamond shards!
  Shard spear? :o  Something about dark crystals. 

backup occasionally, eh?


SPACE
=====
WORLD ENTITIES
--------------
Space needs "WorldEntities" (WE). These will let you move sets of blocks around however you like; they can translate smoothly, and rotate arbitrarily. We may also like to let them support nesting and scaling. It will be possible for players and other entities to hop onto a WEW, and between WEWs/the vanilla world.
Code structure for a WEW:
  class WorldEntity extends Entity { //WE
    class WorldEntityWorld extends World { } //WEW
  }
Implementation thoughts:
  Wrap the WEW ticks with a "push/pop world to entity" network packet. If this turns out that this is sending a lot of "push NO-OP pop", we might be able to have it be sent only when other packets are.
  Client: When we get a WEW change, we'll change Minecraft.theWorld, and Minecraft.thePlayer.theWorld (a local change)
  We may need to do something funky for cross-WEW interactions (such as mining/placing blocks, or drawing the bounding box)
  Active rotation will be difficult, but *very* much wanted. Collisions may be difficult.
  We will need a function to convert one WEW's coords & rotation to another.
  Not a core requirement, but it might be good to create "ghost entities" that reflect the player's coords across WEWs so that skeles can accurately shoot between WEWs
  When an entity intersects/leaves the bounds of a WEW, its worldObj must be adusted.
  If entity IDs aren't universally unique & constant, there may be trouble with nesting and transferring.
Rendering:
  This shouldn't be too difficult, actually! I expect this will render just as efficiently as regular stuff. But try to use as much Mojang code as possible! I'll need to read more MC code.
  If we're lucky, we can do something really easy like "Minecraft.renderWorld(WEW)", altho might need to swap out global vars or something.

Uses:
  Asteroids (Natural/Artificial Satelites, Planetoids, motherships)
  Space ships
  Megabosses
  Rotatable Frames? Robotics? Real Mecha Suits?
ASTEROIDS
---------
Asteroids are WEs. 


COSMOLOGY
---------
The world is an infinite plane. Other dimensions (nether, end, mystcraft ages) are not something you can walk to. The Farlands/End of the World don't actually exist, since that's just an artificial limitation of the computer game.
Light has no speed limit, but it does have a propagation limit. Light comes in several classes. A photon has these properties: Color, direction, travel distance, and class (sky illumination, torch/block illumination, reflection of illumination, and entity/FX-emitted). Steve's retinas can only perceieve reflected and emitted light, not illumination; they also can not detect photons that have travelled over a certain distance.
The world of Minecraft is an infinite plane suspend above over an infinite black hole. The black hole plane will crush anything that gets near it. It can bend light (causing void fog). If you fall into the void, your view will be squashed!
Inverium is what prevents the world from falling into the void. It can be found only underneath bedrock. Don't mine it; that would cause the world to fall into the void. Inverium is anti-void. You can try dropping it into the void, but it will float at around y=1
Inverium can also be found in the asteroids above. If you remove the inverium from them, they will (eventually, not immediately) fall to the ground. (But they will most likely burn up in the atmosphere?)
The inverium supporting the overworld has guardians. We wouldn't want the world to fall down, now would we?

  only allows in items with color/dye names. Sorts them automagically by color.
  proooobably won't be able to implement ISidedInventory decently. :(
  How will the server know what's colored?
    1. Create a list of all the colored dyes. Be sure to check the OreDictionary for dyes..
    2. Iterate over all the crafting recipes:
      If the recipe contains a single item from the list (and any additional items not on the list), add it to the list.
    3. Repeat step 2 until nothing else is added.
  each color gets 3 slots
  clicking on a slot will put it in the regular inventory.
  And... stuff added to the regular inventory'll try to be moved to their color slots.

  Okay. So items can be taken from the slots, but they can't be put in. They have to be inserted indirectly via the extra
  slots on the bottom.

Wand of Cooling:
  Eliminate any lava that you're in (TODO: works poorly)
  Due to the durability & simplicity of its components, the Wand of Cooling lasts for a fairly long time.
  Used to make a refrigerator? Carnot engines?

bag of holding
  Crafting recipe:
      lol   Leather, Ender pearl, dark iron
      IlI
       I
  Upgrade size by crafting with an enderpearl, a dark iron ingot, and leather. Each upgrade adds a single column. 
  OR, we could upgrade by adding other bags? That'd be cool too.
  maybe which vertical slot it is in selects functionality?
  possible TODO:
    shift-` to move items the other way?
    Right click the bag to open up its inventory. Or ctrl-`?


Mecha-upgrades:
  Free:
    bouyancy barrel
    internal piston
    cobblestone drive
  Electric:
    charcoal filter
    thermal environmental control
    sugar water?
  Inverium:
    upgrades from slowing falling to slight hovering to flying amongst the birds
    something to feed you
    



Clay
  clay ball above wooden slab --> modelling stand
  clay ball on stick --> modelling tool
    Icon: A clay ball on a stick! With an additional icon...

  modelling tools: Doesn't stack. Any tool can be converted to another one. shift-right click to change tools.
    adder: consumes a clay ball to add a prism, a centered .5², and selects it
      green +
    remover: removes selected prism, returns a clay ball
      red -
    selector: right click selects a nearby prism (or a prism that's behind what's currently selected), left click cycles selection
      yellow box
      (Shift left-click with any tool might also work as a selector)
    translator: right click to move a prism 1 pixel (configable) towards you; left click to move away (snapped to axiis...)
      blue «
    rotator: rotates prism cc (or ccw) 15° along the axis you are looking down
      magenta ⟳
    stretcher: moves the nearest face of selected 1 px towards you (Will be difficult when rotating...)
      orange <|
  prisms may move outside of the 1m cube, but no farther than a 3m cube
  You should be able to walk on them!
  However, rotated stuff may be tricky... perhaps no collision for them?
    BUT, stuff that's rotated in 90° increments should collide still.
  Make selected prism yellow. If not collidable, perhaps make it magenta.
  Selection should be user-independent! But we might want an indication of what other users have selected... maybe a white outline or sommat.


  So, it's all clay to begin with. Then bisque it. No longer editable. May then be glazed, or made into a mold.
  glazed pieces can be fired again to get rid of the modelling stand, and make them permament.



Rockets
    Fueld with vast amounts of TNT. Must be made with high-fire clay... or extreme high fire clay? :O

[19:02:37] <ShaRose> ok
[19:03:04] <ShaRose> we can't (easily) use bytecode hackery to edit every mod that hardcodes -256 to -4096
[19:03:18] <ShaRose> but if they use that method, we change that one method and we don't need to do anything else
[19:05:09] <CowedOffACliff> okay now I see the difference
[19:07:53] <absurdHuman> What are we supposed to do instead of subtract 256 from everything?
[19:08:17] <CowedOffACliff> What class does that method actually want though?....
[19:08:34] <-- armed_troop has left this server (Quit: armed_troop).
[19:08:37] <CowedOffACliff> does it want a subclass of ItemBlock, or ItemBlock itself?
[19:10:20] <ShaRose> absurdHuman honestly, the way I did it for ID resolver (detecting the offset) was to check the first item
[19:10:26] <ShaRose> I think it's shovelsteel?
[19:10:34] <ShaRose> just get the index from that, that's the offset to use
[19:10:38] <absurdHuman> hmm
[19:10:48] <cpw> cowed any subclass of ItemBlock
[19:10:52] <ShaRose> if forge decides to move blocks higher than 256 to 32001+ though, that won't work either
[19:10:54] <cpw> or just ItemBlock
[19:11:00] <ShaRose> yeah
[19:11:01] <cpw> look at ironchest for an example of use
[19:11:02] <CowedOffACliff> I guess I just don't have the right constructor
[19:11:06] <CowedOffACliff> or something
