The neptunepink mod-dev drinking game! The rules:
Take a SHOT each time he:
  - manually types a variant of "x, y, z" (including this one)
  - uses the wrong cardinal direction
  - adds a function to Coord.java
  - writes TODO or XXX in a comment
  - pulls a variable out of a function & makes it static
  - spaces out for longer than 5 minutes
  - refers to a client-only class or method in a method that isn't
  - uses println without a NORELEASE
  - releases code that has NORELEASEs in it that aren't FZDS-related
  - makes a shoddy git commit

ANTISHOTS cancel out regular SHOTS. Take an ANTISHOT each time he:
  - fixes a bug in a released version
  - uses a Coord function (max 1 anti-shot per function per session)
  - makes an awesome or cool texture

The SNACK is a peanut, or m&m, or similar. Eat N snacks when he:
  - creates an internal class; N=8
  - uses a pre/post increment/decrement in a boolean test; N=2
  - tries to use code hotswaping, but it fails; N=3
  - undoes something in the SHOTS section; N between 1 and 6
  - makes a git commit; N=1

Bonus rule: Every time Lex makes a spelling mistake or typo, take a shot. Limit 1 per contiguous set of sentences.
