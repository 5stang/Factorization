This mod adds minimalist parts for expanding vanilla redstone automation, along with many other things.


[u][b][size=6][anchor=INSTALL]Installation[/anchor][/size][/b][/u]
This is a [url="http://files.minecraftforge.net/"]Minecraft Forge[/url] mod.

1. Download and run the [url="http://files.minecraftforge.net/"]Minecraft Forge Installer[/url]. The version of Forge that I'm using is given by the download link. Anything newer will usually work, and sometimes older versions will work as well.
2. Check that the forge install worked by running the client (or the server). Forge information should be on the title screen (or in the server's logs). Stop minecraft.
3. Put Factorization.jar into the mods folder.

First, you need to obtain a Logic Matrix Programmer. It can then be used in the recipe below to create the Factorization Manual.

[u][b][size=6][anchor=BUGS]Bugs & Other Problems[/anchor][/size][/b][/u]
For faster customer service, please report bugs & other problems to me in #factorization on irc.esper.net; I don't make a habit of reading this thread.

If something seems like it should be easier than it is, let me know; I tend to have a bit of a heavy hand with these things. Small/simple/tiny feature requests may be welcomed, but Ideas are not.
