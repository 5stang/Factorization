=== Actually Dangerous Battle Rewrite ===
Weapons for each component that it drops. Normal cracked blocks drop dark iron ingots.
Whenever a crack is mined, it uses a technique that gets rid of the player and places itself in an advantageous spot maybe? Also equips a new weapon
player-disposal-techniques:
    fall through the ground, pop out elsewhere; players that might be where it's about to return get launched away; spawns particles @ ground before it pops out
    tilt over sideways (and magnetically push the player away)
Unarmed colossi must be somewhat able to hold its own:
    must move faster in general
    must actually kind of move towards the player to attack
    ground pound: ground pounds, causes standing-on-ground players to get launched dangerously high into the air
    leaping towards target if it's far away
    quickly turning 180째
    hammer smashing
    face plant (blinding & melting through ground if successful?)
    extremely quick 180째/90째 spin; snap noise; teleport-spin
weapon textures must be cracked, indicating minability

=== Engagement ===

After the player has completed particular achievements, 'e is given a "Weird Tablet".
Using the tablet will show a screen like:
    <Iron Boots Item> 2.4 km North-East
    <Diamond Pickaxe Item> <Cracked Colossal Block Item>
The player is supposed to follow the tablet's guide to the nearest sleeping colossus.
The colossus has 2 legs, 2 arms, a body, a mask, and a dirt blob on its back.
    The awakened colossi has exactly 5 body parts: the 4 limbs, and the body/head/mask/earthblob combo
On the colossus's front is a cracked colossal block.
The player is supposed to mine the block, which drops some loot and awakens the colossus.
    And hopefully 'e won't instead go mining the earth blob on its back. That might make the boss more difficult.
The boss bar appears, and is at 20% (and will never go higher), and shows no name.
The colossal eyes are still closed, and the colossus uses INITIAL_BOW. Epic awakening noise!
Two more cracks appear on the colossus, on the head behind the mask, 1 block away from the left & right edges. Epic cracking noises!
The player is supposed to continue mining the cracks, and also not die.
When the first new crack is mined, the colossi stands up and learns WANDER_AROUND_AIMLESSLY. It's not very effective.
When the second new crack is mined, the colossi learns & uses LEAN_BACK_AND_FLAIL_AROUND.
Another even more epic cracking noise! The rest of the cracks appear. The name in the boss bar becomes random gibberish instead of nothing.
When all of the cracks are mined, the colossi immediately falls on its back and executes the self-destruct sequence, the true boss name is revealed, there's a MEGA-AWESOME-EPIC death noise, and the player gets a sweet reward.
Each time a crack is mined:
    a new technique is learned
    a defensive technique is used
    the colossus loses a unit of health
    some eyes open
    the crack drops loot
While the boss is alive, idle techniques are used. It also checks if a known offensive technique can be used on nearby players.
The defensive techniques are used only after taking damage.
Besides jumping up arms & legs, the player can get to the cracks by climbing/mining the earth lump, or from a nerd pole.

=== Offensive Techniques ===

INITIAL_BOW:
    bows forward and spreads its arms out so that the player can climb up. 
    Holds this position until hurt.

BOW:
    Replaces INITIAL_BOW; but the colossus will eventually get back up.

HAMMAR:
    Lunges forward, smashing a player on the ground.
    Possibly requires math.
    Replaces the BOW technique.
    If the player dodges, 'e can climb up an arm or a leg.

KICK:
    Quickly swings its leg in the direction of the player if 'e is nearby
    The math is probably less horrible.

BELLY_FLOP:
    Flops on a player.
    Has a warning noise.
    Takes its sweet time getting back up to make the belly accessible.

PUNT:
    Run towards the player if 'e is far away; KICK presumably happens next


=== Defensive Techniques ===

LEAN_BACK_AND_FLAIL_AROUND:
    The colossus body leans back a bunch, and the arms swing in circles
    It might cause the player to fall off.

SPIN:
    Stands on one leg and spins at high speed with arms extended
    Lame?

SHRUG:
    The colossus jumps up sharply, and physics sends the player high in the air

SEMI_CARTWHEEL:
    The colossus does like a half-cartwheel spin with its back at 45째 to the ground


=== Idle Techniques ===

WANDER_AROUND_AIMLESSLY:
    You won't believe what this technique does!

SIT:
    Only if there are no nearby players.
    Possibly not worth the effort of implementing. Would be kind of cool tho.

STAND_STILL:
    This mother of 2 did absolutely nothing using this one weird trick!
