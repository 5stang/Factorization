We'll have several stacks:
  Primary       •
  Alternate     •'
  Stack         ␣  (with dot in center)
  AltStack      ␣' (with dot in center)
  BlockEnter    ↙
  BlockExit     ↖
  Redstone      ¡
  Iteration     o
  IO            io
  Inventory     #     (Or possibly not. But we *should* be able to carry items!)

We'll have a few vars to go with these:
  executing stack & program counter
  parameter stack

The entirety of the stack will be executed immediately, in a single tick. Therefore we can't permit looping in any way. (And we'll also need a limit to the size of a stack, but meh)
And then we'll also need to limit the # of physical interactions that can occur. Hmm.
So we'll need to be able to cancel stack evaluation & then continue them.
  ... and also Redstone could pulse twice during this...
    Well, if it does, we could just ignore it if we're executing anything.
