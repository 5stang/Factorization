\title{The Comparator}

The comparator has a number of uses.
It deals with signals of varying strength.

% a + b = -(-a - b)

It can be used to measure the fullness of a block.
When used with inventories,
the strength of its output will be proportional
to the fullness of the inventory.
This also applies to many other blocks that are
not inventories.
When measuring an inventory in this way,
it can have a solid block between it
and the inventory.
