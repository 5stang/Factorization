\title Compression Crafter

This machine crafts using blocks.
It is built like a ring,
with an inner area ranging from 3x3 to 1x1.
The crafting table faces must point inwards.
It can be built flat, or vertically.

It is activated with a redstone signal.
There must be an inventory for the results of crafting
to be output to.
The side that recieves the redstone signal defines
the bottom of the crafting grid.

Blocks can be converted to item form in different ways.
The contents of barrels will be used as-is.
A circle of 9 barrels full of cobblestone will make
up to 32 furnaces.

The item that a block drops can be used,
as can the item dropped broken with silk touch.
A line of 3 smoothstone will make cobblestone slabs,
but a 2x2 of smoothstone will make stone bricks.

Finally, the block can be broken, and then uncrafted.
Two wooden logs can be used to make 4 wooden pressure plates.

\p
To craft a piston, three wooden logs, 4 smoothstone, a block of iron, and a block of redstone
will make 1 piston, 9 planks, 8 iron, and 8 redstone.
