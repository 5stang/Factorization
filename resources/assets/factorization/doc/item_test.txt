We need an item. Hmm. [\#item.factorization:tool/matrix_programmer] and there's our item! We need a bit more text so that we can see how badly it messes with the line height. Also why is this text purple.


Here's another item: \#item.factorization:servo/component.fz.instruction.entryControl

And another one! \#tile.clayHardenedStained.gray

This one is a link. \link:index\#item.factorization:tool/matrix_programmer\endlink
