\title Barrels

Barrels can store up to 64 stacks of a single item.
So, one of them can store 64 * 64 = 4096 sticks,
64 swords, or 64 * 16 = 1024 eggs.

The barrel has no GUI.
Right click with an item to insert an item,
and left click to remove a stack.
Shift left clicking will remove a single item.
Double right-clicking will insert all the matching items in your inventory into the barrel.

Barrels can have any direction and orientation.
Clicking near the side edge of a block will place the barrel
with its top pointing to that side.

\newpage
There are a few important varieties of barrel.

The hopping barrel will pull one item from its above into it,
and push one item out its bottom, at the same speed as a
vanilla hopper. It also hops.

The silky barrel will hold its contents if broken with
a silk-touch axe.


\newpage

If you're strong enough, you can push barrels with a knockback sword.
Be wary when pushing them up stairs, as they can slip.
