\title{The Item Shifter}

The item shifter is a \link{socket}{socket tool}
that moves items to and from its backing inventory
into an inventory in front of it.

The item shifter has a few settings, which can be configured
with a \lmp.

The direction that it moves items can be controlled.
By default, items are moved from the exporting inventory
into the other.

The operating mode of the shifter can be changed.
There are three modes:
\- Stream Items. In this mode, it behaves like a hopper,
except that it requires a redstone signal to operate.
\- Pulse Exact. The number of items to be moved can be specified.
In this mode, if it can not move exactly that many items,
then it will move no items.
It will attempt to move items each time it gets a redstone pulse.
\- Pulse Some. In this mode, it will transer up to the specified
number of items per redstone pulse.

The transfer limit is how many items will be moved.
In Stream Items mode, only 1 item will be moved at a time.

The target slot controls which slot the item shifter will
put items into.
This only applies to the inventory in front of it,
it does nothing to the backing inventory.
It can be set to target either the entire inventory,
or a specific slot.
