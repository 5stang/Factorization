ELECTRICITY, MK III
===================

* This is based on the original design.
* Wires are placed in the space between blocks, as described in the MK II design
* Generators add power to the enet using 'sum' instead of 'max'.
    - 'max' makes interopability difficult due to breaking conservation of energy
* 1 unit of charge is defined as having the energy required to smelt 1 item, or push a solid block 16 meters, or rotate a solid block completely
* If the power density exceeds 64 charge/block, then the extra energy spawns in a spark demon
* Resistor destroys 1 charge/tick until the density reaches 32 charge/block. Redstone signal disables
* Diode allows one-way flow of energy. A redstone signal disables all energy flow.
* Battery/leyden jar take in energy if > 48, release energy if < 24
    - The capacity of the battery must change to be appropriate to its crafting cost
    - Leyden jar has higher capacity than the battery
    - Transfers up to 5 charge/tick
    - Redstone signal disables energy transfer
    - Comparator measures storage
